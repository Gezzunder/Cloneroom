Meant more as a "how to" than an actual release, feel free to use the codebase to knock up your own.

Installation;

1. Pack the Cloneroom subfolder into a pbo and stick it in the server addons folder
2. Start the server and gaze in wonder at the glory that is the cloneroom.

To understand the process used, see the relevant post on the Epoch forums.

Amphi.Altis is a demo mission to play with the process.
